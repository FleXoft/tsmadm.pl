# tsmadm.pl

ABOUT

With tsmadm.pl you can do your daily TSM / Spectrum Protect chores in a truly task oriented way.

IDEA and STORY

The idea itself and the previous version of this program was prepared when I started to work with TSM seven years ago.
At that time the program was called mtsm.pl and you can still find a copy at adsm.org.
We strated to write this enhanced version at the end of 2010 when Marcell joined the team. Based on day-to-day experience with TSM we had some new ideas we wanted to incorporate into the code.
While we were writing the program my old pal Zolt√°n joined us for a short period of time to help us with some minor cosmetic changes.

Finaly v1.0beta was ready by the end of May, 2011.
